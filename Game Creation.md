# Game Creation

When playing (game-name) the first thing the players need to do is create the world in which they will play.

## Overview

A basic overview of the process is listed bellow, If you group does not have an answer for each steep don't worry. Just make note of if to come once other parts are complete.

Game Creation has () steps:

    1. Establish Lines and a Veils
    2. Come up with the basic rules of magic/super-science in your game world
    3. Create the Opposition
    4. Create some neutral Factions for the setting
    5.

## Lines and Veils

The first thing that should be done when creating a game is to establish the boundaries and topics that each player (and this of course includes the GM) is comfortable with.

### Lines

Lines represent the topics that **should not** come up in play in at. This means both onscreen and offscreen. This doesn't mean that their can not be dark themes at play in the campaign its just the Lines represent issues that will cause harm in at least one of the players

### Veils

Veil on the other hand are topics that should only come up in fade to black or panning away moments. Its fine for these to be in the story, but they should never come up in graphic detail.

### X-Card

## Creating the Opposition

In (game-name) the PC represent a team of people that stand against some force that wishes to take over and shape the world to their desires. The players and GM work together to create this opposition force, as this helps to create both the world the game takes place in and the factions at work in the world.

### The Big Bad(s)

Final End Boss

### Lieutenants

<span class="game-term">Lieutenants</span> are the people oversee and carry out the various actions of the Big Bad (if there is one, see sidebar No Honor pg.xx). As such they are forces the PCs will have to do battle with the most. However, Each Lieutenant has their own specialty, personality and tactics, which means that they are often at cross purpose with one another even if they have the same goals.  This is deliberate to let the players take advantage of enemy infighting.

#### Creating Lieutenants

There should be 3-5 Lieutenants in the game.
