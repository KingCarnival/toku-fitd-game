# Heat

The city is full of prying eyes and informants. Anything you do might be witnessed, and there’s always evidence left behind. To reflect this, your crew acquires <span class="game-term">heat</span> as they commit crimes. After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes <span class="game-term">heat</span> according to the nature of the operation:

* <span class="game-term">0 heat:</span> Smooth &amp; quiet; low exposure.
* <span class="game-term">2 heat:</span> Contained; standard exposure.
* <span class="game-term">4 heat: </span>Loud &amp; chaotic; high exposure.
* <span class="game-term">6 heat:</span> Wild; devastating exposure.

Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> for a high-profile or well-connected target. Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if the situation happened on hostile turf. Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if you’re at war with another faction. Add +2 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if killing was involved (whether the crew did the killing or not—bodies draw attention).

You mark <span class="game-term">heat</span> levels on the <span class="game-term">heat</span> tracker on the crew sheet.

@TODO add table p91

When your <span class="game-term">heat</span> level reaches 9, you gain a <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> and clear your <span class="game-term">heat</span> (any excess <span class="game-term">heat</span> “rolls over,” so if your <span class="game-term">heat</span> was 7 and you took 4 <span class="game-term">heat</span>, you’d reset with 2 <span class="game-term">heat</span> marked).

The higher your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>, the more serious the response when law enforcement takes action against you (they’ll send a force of higher **quality** and **scale**).

Also, your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> contributes to the severity of the **entanglements** that your crew faces after a score. See page <a>94</a> for details.

## Incarceration

The only way to reduce your crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is through incarceration. When one of your crew members, friends, contacts—or a framed enemy—is convicted and incarcerated for crimes associated with your crew, your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is reduced by 1 and you clear your <span class="game-term">heat</span>.

Incarceration may result from investigation and arrest by the officers, or because someone turns themselves in and takes the fall for the crew’s crimes.

The severity of the prison sentence depends on your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>:

* <span class="game-term">Wanted Level 4: </span>Life or execution.
* <span class="game-term">Wanted Level 3:</span> A year or two.
* <span class="game-term">Wanted Level 2:</span> Several months.
* <span class="game-term">Wanted Level 1:</span> A month or two.
* <span class="game-term">Wanted Level 0:</span> A few weeks. Or, the constables give you a beating to teach you a lesson (suffer level 3 harm, no resistance roll allowed—they keep going until you’re injured).

Incarceration is dehumanizing and brutal. The renown of your crew is your only real defense inside. When you serve your time, make an **incarceration roll** using your crew’s Tier as the dice pool.

## Prison claims

@TODO add table p93

### Allied claim

One of your allies on the inside arranges for their faction to grant you a boon. Take a claim for your crew from a different crew type. You can’t take turf with this claim.

### Cell block control

Your crew has a cell block under their total control—guards and all. You never take <span class="game-term">trauma</span> from incarceration.

### Guard payoff

You claim several prison guards on your payroll. Take +1d to your Tier roll when a member of your crew is incarcerated.

### Hardcase

Your reputation as a tough inmate bolsters your crew’s image. When your crew advances Tier, it costs 2 fewer <span class="game-term">coins</span> than it normally would.

### Parole influence

Political pressures of various sorts can be applied to the magistrates and warden who oversee sentences for crimes. With this claim, you’re always able to arrange for a shorter prison stay—as if your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> was 1 lower. So, if your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> was 3 when you went in, you’d spend only several months behind bars (equivalent to level 2) instead of a full year.

### Smuggling

You arrange smuggling channels inside. You have **+**2 load** while incarcerated, (starting from zero as a prisoner). If you take this claim twice, you’ll have 4 load while you’re serving time in Ironhook. Also, you may choose to carry <span class="game-term">coin</span> in place of load for purposes of bribes or acquiring assets while in prison. You may reset the items in your prison loadout whenever your crew has downtime.
