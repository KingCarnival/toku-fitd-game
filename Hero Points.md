# Hero Points

Hero Points are a resource that represnt grit, luck, and chance that heroes enjoy as a part of the genre. This is a resource avalible to the crew that any member can use.

Any crew member can spend a Hero Point to add **+1d** to any action roll, only one Hero Point can spent this way.

Hero Points are gained in two ways. At the start of every mission you reset to the default value as given by your crew playbook. @TODO (Add playbook examples)

Also whenever you roll a **6**  or a **critical** result on a **risky** action that you have not spent a Hero Point on, your crew gains another Hero Point.
