# Missions

Mission are the core element of play in (game).

The basic structure falls into two different types:

    1. Reactive Missions: These missions are the result of an attack either, from a monster from the opposition or a natural or Source-born disater.
    2. Active Missions: These missions are when the crew actively seeks out a target.
