## Crew special abilities

Create seven special abilities for your crew. Here are several examples.

### Deadly

Each PC may add +1 action rating to <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowl</span>, or <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> (up to a max rating of 3).

> Each player may choose the action they prefer (you don’t all have to choose the same one). If you take this ability during initial character and crew creation, it supersedes the normal starting limit for action ratings.

### Death veil

Due to hard-won experience or occult ritual, you don’t take extra <span class="game-term">heat</span> when killing is involved on a score.

### No traces

When you keep an operation quiet or make it look like an accident, you get half the <span class="game-term">rep</span> value of the target (round up) instead of zero. When you end downtime with zero <span class="game-term">heat</span>, take **+1** <span class="game-term">rep</span>.

> There are many clients who value quiet operations. This ability rewards you for keeping a low-profile.

### Patron

When you advance your **Tier**, it costs half the <span class="game-term">coin</span> it normally would.

> Who is your patron? Why do they help you?

### Predators

When you use a stealth or deception plan to commit murder, take **+1d** to the **engagement roll**.

> This ability applies when the goal is murder. It doesn’t apply to other stealth or deception operations you attempt that happen to involve killing.

### Fiends

Fear is as good as respect. You may count each <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> as if it were **turf**.

> The maximum <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is 4. Regardless of how much turf you hold (from this ability or otherwise) the minimum <span class="game-term">rep</span> cost to advance your Tier is always 6._

### Forged in the fire

Each PC has been toughened by cruel experience. You get **+1d** to **resistance** rolls.

> This ability applies to PCs in the crew. It doesn’t confer any special toughness to your cohorts.

### War dogs

When you’re at war (-3 faction status), your crew does not suffer -1 hold and PCs still get two downtime activities, instead of just one.

### Anointed

You gain **+1d** to **resistance** rolls against supernatural threats. You get **+1d** to healing rolls when you have supernatural harm.

### Accord

Sometimes friends are as good as territory. You may treat up to three **+3 faction** statuses** you hold as if they are **turf**.

> If your status changes, you lose the turf until it becomes +3 again. Regardless of how much turf you hold (from this ability or otherwise) the minimum <span class="game-term">rep</span> cost to advance your Tier is always 6.

### High society

It’s all about who you know. Take **-1 **<span class="game-term">heat</span>** **during downtime and **+1d** to **gather information** about the city’s elite.

### Pack rats

Your lair is a jumble of stolen items. When you roll to **acquire an asset**, take **+1d**.

> This ability might mean that you actually have the item you need in your pile of stuff, or it could mean you have extra odds and ends to barter with.

### Second story

When you execute a clandestine infiltration, you get **+1d** to the **engagement roll**.

### Synchronized

When you perform a **group action**, you may count multiple 6s from different rolls as a <span class="game-term">critical</span> success.

> For example, Lyric leads a group action to <span class="game-term">Attune</span> to the ghost field to overcome a magical ward on the Dimmer Sisters’ door. Emily, Lyric’s player, rolls and gets a <span class="game-term">6</span>, and so does Matt! Because the crew has Synchronized, their two separate <span class="game-term">6</span>s count as a <span class="game-term">critical</span> success on the roll.

### All hands

During **downtime**, one of your **cohorts** may perform a downtime activity for the crew to **acquire an asset**, **reduce** <span class="game-term">heat</span>, or work on a **long-term project**.

### Just passing through

During **downtime**, take **-1 **<span class="game-term">heat</span>. When your <span class="game-term">heat</span> is 4 or less, you get **+1d** to deceive people when you pass yourselves off as ordinary citizens.
