# Actions & Attributes

## Action Ratings

There are 12 **actions** in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles.

* Attune
* Command
* Consort
* Finesse
* Hunt
* Prowl
* Skirmish
* Study
* Survey
* Sway
* Tinker
* Wreck

Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training—you’re free to describe _how_ your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at <span class="game-term">Command</span> because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an **action roll** to see how it turns out.

## Action Roll

You make an **action roll** when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s **position**. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. If you’re in a **controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a **desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s **risky**—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.

If there’s no danger or trouble at hand, you don’t make an action roll. You might make a **fortune** roll or a **downtime** roll or the GM will simply say yes—and you accomplish your goal.

## Attribute Ratings

There are three **attributes** in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: <span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, and <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the **first column** under that attribute (see the examples, at right). The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.

## Resistance Roll

Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating. Resistance rolls always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll, the less **stress** it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.

When the enemy has a big advantage, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you duel the master sword-fighter, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your blade if you want to attack her. Or perhaps you face a powerful ghost and attempt to <span class="game-term">Attune</span> with it to control its actions. But before you can make your own roll, you must resist possession from the spirit.

The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.

For details on **Resistance Rolls**, see page 28.

As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> _might_ be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).
