# Entanglements

Your crew didn’t just spring into existence tonight. You have a complex history of favors, commitments, debts, and promises that got you where you are today. To reflect this, after each score, you roll dice to find out which **entanglement** comes calling. An entanglement might be a rival crew looking to throw their weight around (and demand some <span class="game-term">coin</span>), an Investigator of the City Watch making a case against your crew (but ready for a bribe), or even the attention of a vengeful ghost.

After payoff and <span class="game-term">heat</span> are determined, the GM generates an entanglement for the crew using the lists below. Find the column that matches the crew’s current <span class="game-term">heat</span> level. Then roll a number of dice equal to their <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>, and use the result of the roll to select which sort of entanglement manifests. _If <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is zero, roll two dice and keep the lowest result._

@TODO add table p94

Bring the entanglement into play immediately, or hold off until an appropriate moment. For example, if you get the _Interrogation_ entanglement, you might wait until a PC indulges their vice, then say the costables picked them up when they were distracted by its pleasures.

Entanglements manifest fully before the PCs have a chance to avoid them. When an entanglement comes into play, describe the situation after the entanglement has manifested. The PCs deal with it from that point—they can’t intercept it and defuse it before it happens. The purpose of the mechanic is to abstract a lot of the complex stuff happening in the backgrounds of the characters’ lives in order to generate trouble for them. Entanglements are the cost of doing business in the underworld—a good crew learns to roll with the punches and pick their battles.

The entanglements are detailed on the following pages. Each has a list of potential ways for the PCs to be rid of it. If you want the entanglements to be a momentary problem for the crew, stick to the suggested methods to resolve them, and move on to the next part of downtime. If you want to dive in and explore the entanglement in detail, set the scene and play out the event in full, following the actions and consequences where they lead.

### Arrest

An Inspector presents a case file of evidence to a magistrate, to begin prosecution of your crew. They send a detail to arrest you (a gang at least equal in **scale** to your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>). Pay them off with <span class="game-term">coin</span> equal to your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> +3, hand someone over for arrest (this clears your <span class="game-term">heat</span>), or try to evade capture.

> A truncheon bangs on the shutters of the window. “Alright then! Come on out and let’s go quietly now!” It sounds like the bald Sergeant. When you peek out, you see a detail of about twenty constables, all geared up for a fight. The Sergeant mumbles under his breath, so only you inside can hear: “Or perhaps I have the wrong address?” He clears his throat and waits for some coin to appear.

### Cooperation

A +3 status faction asks you for a favor. Agree to do it, or forfeit 1 <span class="game-term">rep</span> per Tier of the friendly faction, or lose **1 status** with them. If you don’t have a +3 faction status, you avoid entanglements right now.

### Demonic notice

A demon approaches the crew with a dark offer. Accept their bargain, hide until it loses interest (forfeit<span class="game-term"> </span>3 <span class="game-term">rep</span>), or deal with it another way.

### Flipped

One of the PCs’ rivals arranges for one of your contacts, patrons, clients, or a group of your customers to switch allegiances due to the <span class="game-term">heat</span> on you. They’re loyal to another faction now.

### Gang trouble

One of your gangs (or other cohorts) causes trouble due to their flaw(s). You can lose face (forfeit<span class="game-term"> rep</span> equal to your Tier +1), make an example of one of the gang members, or face reprisals from the wronged party.

### Interrogation

The officers round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew’s crimes. _How did they manage to capture you?_ Either pay them off with 3 <span class="game-term">coin</span>, or they beat you up (**level 2 harm**) and you tell them what they want to know (**+3** <span class="game-term">heat</span>). You can **resist** each of those consequences separately.

> Some players really hate it when their character gets captured! Just tell them that this is completely normal for a scoundrel of the underworld. You spend time in and out of jail, getting questioned and harassed by the law. It’s not the end of the world. But now that you’re here in the interrogation room, what kind of person are you? Do you talk? Do you stand up to them? Do you make a deal?

### Questioning

The cops grab an NPC member of your crew or one of the crew’s contacts, to question them about your crimes. _Who do they think is most vulnerable?_ Make a **fortune roll** to see how much they talk (<span class="game-term">1-3:</span> **+2** <span class="game-term">heat</span>, <span class="game-term">4/5:</span> **+1** <span class="game-term">heat</span>), or pay the constables off with 2 <span class="game-term">coin</span>.

>Roll 2d for a normal person to see how well they keep quiet. If they’re an experienced underworld type or some kind of tough, give them 3d or 4d instead. If they’re soft or if they have some loyalty to the law, give them 1d or 0d.

### Reprisals

An enemy faction makes a move against you (or a friend, contact, or vice purveyor). Pay them (1 <span class="game-term">rep</span> and 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span>) per Tier of the enemy as an apology, allow them to mess with you or yours, or fight back and show them who’s boss.

### Rivals

A neutral faction throws their weight around. They threaten you, a friend, a contact, or one of your vice purveyors. Forfeit (1 <span class="game-term">rep</span> or 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span>) per Tier of the rival, or stand up to them and lose** 1 status**<span class="game-term"> </span>with them.

### Show of force

A faction with whom you have a negative status makes a play against your holdings. Give them 1 **claim** or go to war (drop to -3 status). If you have no claims, **lose 1 hold** instead.

### Unquiet dead

A rogue spirit is drawn to you—perhaps it’s a past victim? Acquire the services of an occultist to attempt to destroy or banish it, or deal with it yourself.

> They can hire an NPC by using the <span class="game-term">acquire asset</span>_ downtime activity. Roll the NPC’s quality level as a fortune roll to see how well they deal with the spirit.

### The usual suspects

The cops grab someone in the periphery of your crew. One player volunteers a friend or vice purveyor as the person most likely to be taken. Make a **fortune roll** to find out if they resist questioning (<span class="game-term">1-3</span>: **+2 **<span class="game-term">heat</span>**, **4/5:** level 2 harm**), or pay them off with 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span>.
