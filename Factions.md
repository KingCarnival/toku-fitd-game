# Factions
Factions represent third party entities in the battle between the PC and the Villains. As such they represent another avenue for the supplies and intel for both sides. Factions generally fall under three categories: Government, Populace and Business.

## Government
Government factions obviously represent government interests.  As such it is better for these to be use for individual agencies, unless your game focuses on a more world traveling affair.

### Examples
CIA, FBI, Chinese Secret Police, IRS

## Populace
Populace factions are specific movements with the civilians.
## Business
