# Stress & Trauma

## Stress

Player characters in _Blades in the Dark_ have a special reserve called **stress**. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

_During a knife fight, Daniel’s character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating to resist, and gets a <span class="game-term">2</span>. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Cross survives._

_The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm (“Chest Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”)._

## Pushing Yourself

You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you’re incapacitated.

## Trauma

When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of <span class="game-term">trauma</span>. When you take <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, circle one of your **trauma conditions** like _Cold_, _Reckless_, _Unstable_, etc. They’re all described on the next page.

When you suffer <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero stress** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime.

**Trauma conditions are permanent**. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>.

### Trauma Conditions

* <span class="game-term">Cold</span>: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
* <span class="game-term">Haunted</span>: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
* <span class="game-term">Obsessed</span>: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
* <span class="game-term">Paranoid</span>: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.
* <span class="game-term">Reckless</span>: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
* <span class="game-term">Soft</span>: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
* <span class="game-term">Unstable</span>: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
* <span class="game-term">Vicious</span>: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.
