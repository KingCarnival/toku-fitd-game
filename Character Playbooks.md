# Breaker
You are the muscle. The first to charge the line of the monsters and the last to leave
# Oddball
Your methods might seem unorthodox but people can't argue with your results
# Renegade
You worked for the monsters (whether willingly or not) until you saw your chance to escape, now you take advantage of your old contacts to strike back
# Experiment
You were subject to procedures that you couldn't count or remember. At least you got powers to fight back
# Techie
The invanders brought all sorts of new tech and you cant wait to mess with it.
