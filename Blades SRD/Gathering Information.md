# Gathering Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say _everything_—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.

When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can **gather information**. The GM will ask you **how** your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).

If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.

Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.

Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.

The most common gather information actions are <span class="game-term">Surveying</span> the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and <span class="game-term">Studying</span> a person to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.

Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to <span class="game-term">Prowl</span> to a good hiding place first and then <span class="game-term">Study</span> the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.

## Investigation

Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the network of contraband smuggling routes in the city. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a **long-term project** that you work on during **downtime**.

You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.

## Examples &amp; Questions

* You might <span class="game-term">Attune</span> to see echoes of recent spirit activity. _Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Command</span> a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. _What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Consort</span> with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. _What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> a courier across the city, to discover who’s receiving satchels of coin from a master duelsit. _Where does the package end up? How can I find out who signed for the package at City Hall?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Study</span> ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. _How can I disable the runes of warding? __Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Study</span> a person to read their intentions and feelings. _What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a manor house to case it for a heist. _What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a charged situation when you meet another gang. _What’s really going on here? Are they about to attack us?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> a powerful lord at a party so he divulges his future plans. _What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> his bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. _Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?_

# Coin and Stash

## Coin

<span class="game-term">Coin</span> is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets.

The few bits PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll.

## Monetary values

* <span class="game-term">1 coin: </span>A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.
* <span class="game-term">2 coin:</span> A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* <span class="game-term">4 coin:</span> A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.
* <span class="game-term">6 coin:</span> An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* <span class="game-term">8 coin:</span> A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* <span class="game-term">10 coin:</span> Liquidating a significant asset—a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 4<span class="game-term">coin</span> is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A crew can also store 4<span class="game-term CharOverride-5"> </span><span class="game-term">coin</span> in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to <span class="game-term CharOverride-15">8</span> and then 16 <span class="game-term">coin</span>. Any <span class="game-term">coin</span> beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.

One unit of <span class="game-term">coin</span> in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

### Coin Use

* Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> to avoid certain crew **entanglements**.
* Put <span class="game-term">coin</span> in your character’s **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next page.
* Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> when you advance your crew’s **Tier**.

## Stash &amp; Retirement

When you mark your character’s final <span class="game-term">trauma</span> and they retire, the amount of <span class="game-term">coin</span> they’ve managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0-10:** **Poor soul. **You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11-20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21-39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 <span class="game-term">coins</span>) indicates the **quality level of the character’s lifestyle**, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

> Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can’t take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross’s player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage.

### Removing coin from your stash

If you want to pull <span class="game-term">coin</span> out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 **<span class="game-term">coin</span>** in cash.**
