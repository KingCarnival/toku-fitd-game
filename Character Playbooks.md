## Breaker

You are the muscle. The first to charge the line of the monsters and the last to leave

### Starting Actions

#### Starting Builds

### Dangerous Allies

### Starting Ability

#### Unstoppable

You can push yourself to do one of the following: perform a feat
of physical force that verges on the superhuman—engage a small
gang on equal footing in close combat.

> When you push yourself to activate this ability, you still get one of the normal benefits of pushing yourself (+1d, +1 effect, etc.) in addition to the special ability.
A superhuman feat is one a regular person could not do unassisted, such as tearing apart metal handcuffs. If you engage a small gang on equal footing, you have equal scale.
