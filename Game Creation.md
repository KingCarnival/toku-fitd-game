## Creating the Opposition

In (game-name) the PC represent a team of people that stand against some force that wishes to take over and shape the world to their desires. The players and GM work together to create this opposition force, as this helps to create both the world the game takes place in and the factions at work in the world.

### The Big Bad(s)

Final End Boss

### Lieutenants

<span class="game-term">Lieutenants</span> are the people oversee and carry out the various actions of the Big Bad (if there is one, see sidebar No Honor pg.xx). As such they are forces the PCs will have to do battle with the most. However, Each Lieutenant has their own specialty, personality and tactics, which means that they are often at cross purpose with one another even if they have the same goals.  This is deliberate to let the players take advantage of enemy infighting.

#### Creating Lieutenants

There should be 3-5 Lieutenants in the game.
